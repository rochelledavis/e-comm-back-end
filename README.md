# E-Commerce Back End


# Description 
This app allows you to manage the back end of your e-commerce site

# Installation
You will need node.js, dotenv, express, sequelize, and mysql2 installed in order for this to work for you locally. You can then launch mysql and run the schema/sql to get the database going. Once that is done you can run the command "npm run seed" to seed the database with your data. Once that is completed, use the command "npm run start" to see the various routes in action.
